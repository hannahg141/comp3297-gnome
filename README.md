# COMP3297 Software Engineering- GNOME

One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


## Setting up Django

### Environment Setup: Pipenv

`pip install pipenv` will install an isolated environment to maintain projects

### Repo Setup

cd into your directory

`pipenv install django` will install Django in your virtual environment

## 

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Working on Code: Using Git

When you start working on code, you don't want to disrupt the current system. We will be using git. 
Each time you want to work on a feature or a task, you'll create a new branch. 
Start by pulling all the current code from master `git pull` and then `git checkout -b sprint-number/description` to 
create a new independant branch. You will now be on this new branch. Write all your code for this user story / individual
task on this branch, adding code `git add .` to add all the changed files or `git add file-names` to add specific files,
and making commits `git commit -m "descriptive commit message- what changes were made so we can track progress and rollback 
changes"` when necessary.

When you are done with making changes, push all of your commits `git push origin branch-name`. You will see an option to 
create a pull request- click the link. You will be brought to github where you can describe what changes were made, make sure
all the tests pass, and assign specific developers to look over your code. Once another member approves your code, it will can
be merged into the master branch. 

### Writing tests
WRITE THEM!!! UNIT TESTS PLEASE!! I WIL BE TEST HOUND

## Running the tests

```
Give an example
```
